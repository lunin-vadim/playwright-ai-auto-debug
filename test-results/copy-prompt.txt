Test: should login with valid credentials
Browser: chromium
URL: https://example.com/login
Viewport: 1280x720

The test was trying to click the login button but it couldn't find the element with selector 'button[data-testid="login-button"]'. This might be because:
1. The element doesn't exist on the page
2. The element is not visible
3. The page is still loading
4. The selector is incorrect
