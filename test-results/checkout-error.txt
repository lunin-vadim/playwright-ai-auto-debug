Test: should complete checkout process
Browser: chromium
URL: https://example.com/checkout
Viewport: 1280x720

The test was trying to click the payment submit button but couldn't find the element. The checkout form was filled correctly but the final submit button is missing or has a different selector.

Steps that worked:
1. Fill billing information ✅
2. Select payment method ✅
3. Enter card details ✅
4. Click submit button ❌

Please help fix this checkout flow issue.
